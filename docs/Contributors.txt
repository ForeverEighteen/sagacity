Sagacity is a project with a long history.  It began at SAIC in 2008 as a set of Perl scripts, text and CSV files and a spreadsheet used to reduce weeks of boredom, manually copying STIG results from paper checklists to a computer.  At Salient Federal Solutions in 2012 it gained a web interface and a database.  In 2016, thanks to foresighted Air Force personnel who decided to release it, it is an open source, collaborative effort, designed to save hundreds of man-hours assessing STIG and RMF compliance.  Cyber Perspectives, LLC is managing the Sagacity project in the hope that it will be a huge benefit to many in the DoD, Federal and commercial Cyber Security communities.
